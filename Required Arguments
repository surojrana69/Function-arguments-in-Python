#REQUIRED ARGUMENT
# If you don't use the key = value format for arguments, 
# you must pass them in the correct order and ensure the number of arguments matches the function's definition.

def name(firstname, middlename, lastname):
    print("Hello,", firstname, middlename, lastname)

name("Peter", "Quill")

#To correct this code you either need to,

''' def name(firstname, middlename, lastname):
     print("Hello,", firstname, middlename, lastname)

 name("Peter", "Quill", "Hentry")   #OR,

 def name(firstname, middlename, lastname=("Henry")):
      print("Hello,", firstname, middlename, lastname)
 
 name("Peter", "Quill")'''
